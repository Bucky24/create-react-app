## create-react-app

This is a very simplified version of the famous `create-react-app`. If you've found this while looking for that, check https://create-react-app.dev/.

I find the above to be somewhat top-heavy and I don't like that it needs to be "ejected" in order to actually get access to the config files.

This module creates an extremely simple react application after asking some very very simple questions of the user. All config files are available to be edited immediately.
